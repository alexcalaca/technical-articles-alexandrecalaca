## Introduction

In the world of web development, databases play a critical role in storing and managing the data that powers applications. Within a database, tables organize this data into rows and columns, making it easier to retrieve and manipulate. However, as tables grow larger, finding specific pieces of information can become slow and inefficient. This is where indexes come into play.

---

## Indexes

Indexes are special database objects that improve the speed of data retrieval operations, much like an index in a book helps you quickly find the page you're looking for.

## Rails console

```ruby
rails console
```

---

## Connection indexes

Let's use the `connection.indexes` method from ActiveRecord to retrieve the indexes for the desired table.

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.indexes(:your_table)
```

---

### Connection adapters

This will return an array of `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::IndexDefinition` objects, each representing an index on the `your_table` table.

Besides, this will print the name, columns, and uniqueness of each index on the users table.
