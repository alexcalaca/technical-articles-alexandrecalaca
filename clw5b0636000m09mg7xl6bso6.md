## Vite

Vite is a build tool for modern web development that aims to provide a faster and more efficient development experience. It's specifically designed for building web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue, and others. The name "Vite" is derived from the French word for "fast."

### **Check your OS (optional)**

This step is just to make sure you have `Pop!_OS` installed.

**COPY**

```plaintext
uname -a
hostnamectl
lsb_release -a
cat /etc/os-release
```

Output

---

## **Update packages info**

```plaintext
sudo apt-get update
```

Running `sudo apt-get update` is an important step before installing or upgrading packages on your system because it ensures that you have the most up-to-date information about available packages.

Without updating the package index, you might not see the latest versions of software or be able to install new packages that have been added to the repositories since the last update.

---

## **Install Vite Locally**

Make sure that Vite is listed as a dependency in your project's `package.json` file.

If it's not there, you should add it as a development dependency:

```plaintext
npm install --save-dev vite
```

---

## **Check npm Scripts**

Execute this step if you are cloning a React application.

Ensure that your `package.json` file contains the correct npm scripts. In your case, the "dev" script seems to be using "vite". Confirm that the "dev" script is defined as follows:

```plaintext
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite"
}
```

---

## **Verify npm Installation**

```plaintext
which npm
npm --help
```

Make sure that npm is installed.

---

## Install dependencies

Make sure that npm is installed and your project has the required dependencies.

```plaintext
npm install
```

Output

---

## **Check npm Binaries**

Sometimes, the binaries installed by npm may not be in your system's PATH. Ensure that the `node_modules/.bin` directory is in your PATH or try running the command with npx:

```plaintext
npx vite
```

Successful output:

## Start the server

The command npm run dev is typically used to start a development server for a web application. It's part of the npm scripts defined in the "scripts" section of a project's package.json file.

```plaintext
npm run dev
```

Successful output:

## **Done**
