## Problem

The `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` error is an exception raised in Ruby on Rails when an ActiveRecord model fails to be saved to the database due to validation errors

How to handle?

---

## Error

Let's check the exception from different angles.

### Full message

```ruby
ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid in XXXController#action
```

### Explanation

The `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` error is an exception raised in Ruby on Rails when an ActiveRecord model fails to be saved to the database due to validation errors. It typically occurs when you try to save a record that doesn't pass the validations defined in the model.

When you define validations in your Rails model, such as presence validations or format validations, Rails checks if the data being saved meets those requirements. If any of the validations fail, Rails raises the `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` error.

---

## Solutions

### 1- Show the default error page

Rails way to handle it. In this case, you don't need to provide any additional configuration or code.

---

### 2-Use `begin` and `rescue`

```apache
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    begin
      @post = Post.find(params[:id])
    rescue ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid
      flash[:error] = "The requested post could not be created or updated."
      redirect_to root_path
    end
  end
end
```

You can use a `begin/rescue` block to catch and handle the `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` error locally within a method or block of code.

> This approach is suitable when you want to handle the error in a specific section of your code.

---

### 3- Rescue from method

```apache
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid, with: :handle_record_invalid

  def show
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  end

  private

  def handle_record_invalid
    flash[:error] = "The requested post could not be created or updated."
    redirect_to root_path
  end
end
```

You can use `rescue_from` in your Rails controllers to catch the `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` error globally for a specific controller or a group of controllers.

> This approach is suitable when you want to handle the error consistently across multiple actions or when you want to perform specific actions based on the error.

---

## Best error handling strategy

The best approach depends on the specific needs of your application, the complexity of your error handling requirements, and the desired level of consistency in handling `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors.

You can choose either method or even a combination of both based on the context and structure of your Rails application.

Anyway, let's point out some details about both:

---

* ### begin and rescue
    

Using `begin/rescue` block allows you to catch the error explicitly at the point where it occurs and handle it accordingly.

It provides more granular control over error handling within a specific code block.

---

* ### rescue from
    

Using `rescue_from` allows you to define a centralized error handling method that will be called whenever an `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` error is raised within the specified controller(s).

It promotes code reusability and consistency in handling the error.

---

## Conclusion

This error is an essential part of Rails' robust error handling system, providing a clear and informative message to users when a record is invalid.

> By catching the `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` error, you can handle validation failures gracefully and take appropriate steps based on your application's requirements.

it's important to note that Rails offers various techniques to handle this error, including `rescue_from` and `begin`/`rescue` blocks, allowing developers to tailor their error handling approach based on specific requirements and context.
