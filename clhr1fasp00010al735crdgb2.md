## Objective

In this article, we will explore the intricacies of the Object#respond\_to? method and learn how it enables us to check if an object can execute a specific method.

We will delve into the mechanics of this method, understanding how it helps us handle diverse scenarios and make informed decisions about our code's behavior.

---

## Introduction

In the dynamic and flexible world of Ruby programming, the ability to determine the capabilities of an object at runtime is invaluable. Knowing whether a specific object can perform a particular method is crucial for writing robust and adaptable code. Fortunately, Ruby equips us with a powerful tool to tackle this challenge: the `respond_to?` method.

Whether you are an experienced Ruby developer seeking to deepen your understanding or a beginner embarking on your programming journey, this article will equip you with the knowledge and techniques to effectively use the respond\_to? method.

By the end, you will possess the skills to dynamically determine if an object can run a specific method, providing you with greater control and adaptability in your Ruby code.

## respond\_to? method

The `respond_to?` method allows you to check if an object responds to a specific method. It returns true if the object has the method defined, and false otherwise.

```ruby
if object.respond_to?(:method_name)
  # Method is available to the object
else
  # Method is not available to the object
end
```

---

### Creation

The `Object#respond_to?` method has been a part of the Ruby programming language since its early versions. It was introduced in Ruby 1.8.0, which was released on August 4, 2003. This method has been available in all subsequent versions of Ruby, including Ruby 3.0.

---

### Family class

The `Object#respond_to` method belongs to the Object class in Ruby. Since all objects in Ruby are instances of the Object class (or its subclasses), the respond\_to? method is available on every object.

Object is the default root of all Ruby objects. Object inherits from BasicObject which allows creating alternate object hierarchies. Methods on Object are available to all classes unless explicitly overridden.

---

### Kernel module

Object mixes in the Kernel module, making the built-in kernel functions globally accessible.

Although the instance methods of Object are defined by the Kernel module, for the sake of clarity and organization in the documentation, the instance methods that come from Kernel are documented separately within the Object class documentation.

---

### Syntax

```ruby
object.respond_to?(:method_name)
```

In the previous code:

* object It represents the specific object you want to check if it can respond to a method.
    
* respond\_to? It is the name of the method itself.
    
* :method\_name is a symbol representing the name of the method you want to check.
    

---

### Parameters

`Object#respond_to?` is an Object method. There are two parameters: `method_name` and `include_all?`, but only one is required: `method_name` (Symbol/String).

`method_name` can be a Symbol or a String. When the `method_name` parameter is given as a string, the string is converted to a symbol. So, the method can be specified as a symbol or a string.

Let's check two basic examples

```ruby
"mystring".respond_to?(:slice)
"mystring".respond_to?('slice')
```

Both previous examples are going to return true, since "mystring" has access to the `slice` method.

`` `include_all` must return a Boolean value. `` It determines whether the method being checked should include checking for private and protected methods as well.

By default, `include_all` is set to false, meaning only public methods are checked. If set to true, it includes private and protected methods in the check.

The following code shows the default second optional parameter:

```ruby
"mystring".respond_to?(:slice, false)
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the respond\_to? method is an essential tool in the Ruby developer's arsenal. It empowers us to dynamically determine if an object can respond to a specific method, enabling us to write more flexible, adaptable, and robust code.

Throughout this article, we have explored the inner workings of respond\_to? and its significance in the Ruby language.

We have learned how to use respond\_to? to check if an object possesses a particular method, allowing us to conditionally execute code based on its availability.

By leveraging this method, we can gracefully handle different scenarios, ensuring that our code behaves as expected and avoiding potential errors.
