## Dialog

Donald (Dev): Hey there! How's it going `on your end`? Any interesting findings in the `latest build`?

Karen (QA): Hey! Yeah, I've been `digging into` the new `release`, and I `stumbled upon` an `interesting issue`. It looks like we've got a bug on our hands.

Donald (Dev): Oh, really? What's the `scoop`? `Lay it on me.`

Karen (QA): So, I was testing the user authentication module, and it seems like the password reset `functionality` isn't working as expected. Users aren't receiving the reset email, and the link in the email isn't directing them to the password reset `page`.

Donald (Dev): Hmm, `that's concerning`. Thanks for `bringing it up`. Let me take a look at the code and see if I can identify what's `causing the issue`.
