## Introduction

Opening a GitHub project in VS Code online offers unparalleled accessibility and collaboration opportunities. With the ability to access and work on projects from any device with an internet connection, developers can leverage the full power of VS Code's integrated development environment without the need for local installations.

This seamless integration with GitHub streamlines workflows, enabling users to clone repositories, collaborate with others in real-time, and seamlessly push and pull changesâ€”all within a browser-based interface.

This approach fosters continuous development, allowing developers to stay productive and engaged with their projects regardless of their location or device, ultimately enhancing efficiency and enabling smoother collaboration across teams.

## Faster approach

Consider your github repository link

```ruby
# Pattern
https://github.com/organization/repository-name

# Example
https://github.com/apex-sa/apex-payments
```

Just change from `.com` to `.dev`:

```ruby
# Pattern
https://github.dev/organization/repository-name

# Example
https://github.dev/apex-sa/apex-payments
```
