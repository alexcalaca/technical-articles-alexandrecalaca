Danny: Good morning, thanks for having me. Certainly, I have **<mark>extensive experience</mark>** in leading teams and **<mark>mentoring</mark>** junior developers.

Interviewer: That sounds <mark>impressive</mark>. Can you give me an example of a project where you had to guide junior developers through the process?

We had a <mark>t</mark>**<mark>ight deadlin</mark>**<mark>e</mark>, and I was tasked with leading a team of three junior developers. I organized regular meetings to discuss our progress, identified areas where the junior developers needed assistance, and provided <mark>hands-on guidance</mark> and code reviews to ensure the quality and <mark>timely </mark> **<mark>delivery</mark>** of the feature.
