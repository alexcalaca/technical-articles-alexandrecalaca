### Check installation

There are several ways to check your installation, the simplest way is to run the software.

When you run the `which` command with a specific command or program name, it searches through the directories listed in the $PATH environment variable to find the location of the executable file associated with that command. It then displays the absolute path of the executable file on the terminal.
