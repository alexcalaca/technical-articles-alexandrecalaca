---

### 3- Check PostgresQL service

```ruby
sudo service postgresql status
```

You should get something like this

```apache
postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Wed 2023-08-02 07:38:29 -03; 4h 56min ago
    Process: 1489 ExecStart=/bin/true (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 1489 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
        CPU: 1ms
```

### 4- Restart PostgresQL service

The following command is going to start the PostgresQL service:

```apache
sudo service postgresql start
```

The following command is going to restart the PostgresQL service.

```apache
sudo service postgresql restart

---

### 6 - Check the roles/users

In order to check the current/available roles:

```apache
\du
```

You should be able to see something like the following:

```apache
postgres=# \du
                                   List of roles
 Role name |                         Attributes                         | Member of 
-----------+------------------------------------------------------------+-----------
 calaca    | Superuser, Create role, Create DB                          | {}
 postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS | {}

postgres=#
```

In my example, my role name is `calaca`.

---

### 7- Change the password

```apache
ALTER USER calaca WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
```

After the command, you should be able to see something like that:

```apache
postgres=# ALTER USER calaca WITH PASSWORD 'computer';
ALTER ROLE
postgres=#
```

---

### 8- Exit the PostgreSQL terminal

```apache
\q
```

---

### 9- Test the new password

After changing the password for a PostgreSQL user, the user can test the new password by attempting to connect to the PostgreSQL database using the updated credentials.

Here's the template of how the user can test the new password:

```apache
psql -U your_username -d your_database_name -h your_host -W
```

In my example, this is how is going to become:

```apache
 psql -U calaca -d depot_development -h localhost -W
```

Due to the use of `-W`, after running the command, you should be promptly required to enter the password:

```apache
calaca@calaca-PC ~ $ psql -U calaca -d depot_development -h localhost -W
Password: 
```

If your password is correct, you'll be able to enter the PostgreSQL terminal.
