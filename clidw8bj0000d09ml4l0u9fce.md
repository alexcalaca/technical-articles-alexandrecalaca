### Problem

What should I do if I'm chatting with a contact and there is no close or hide button to collapse the emoji panel on the right side?

This situation happens when you're chatting with a contact and it doesn't seem to have a close or hide button to collapse the emoji right side panel.

### Solution

Take a look at the right down corner of your Telegram desktop app. You should be able to see a happy emoji button.

Now, press that button and the bar should disappear.
