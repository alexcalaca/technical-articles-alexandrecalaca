## Update the Package manager repository

```ruby
sudo apt update
```

When you run "sudo apt update," you are essentially telling the system to refresh the local package index by fetching the latest information about available packages from the software repositories configured on your system.

This ensures that you have the most up-to-date information about available software packages before performing installations or upgrades. It doesn't upgrade the installed software; it only updates the local package database.

After running this command, you can use "sudo apt upgrade" to install the latest versions of the packages on your system.

## Install

sudo apt install flameshot -y
```

Output

## Check installation

### Through version

```ruby
flameshot --version
```

---

### Executable file's location

```ruby
which flameshot
```

The output of the "which" command helps you identify the location of the executable file, which is essential if you want to include the tool in scripts or if you need to reference its location for any other purpose.
