## Conversation

### Dialog

**Stanley**: Hi Sophie, it's nice to meet you. Before we `dive into` the technical questions, why don't we chat a bit to get to know each other better?

**Sophie**: Hi Stanley, sure! That sounds good to me.

**Stanley**: Great! So, you're from Brazil, right? `What's it like` there?

**Sophie**: Yes, I am! Brazil is amazing. The weather is usually warm and sunny, especially where I live in Rio de Janeiro. How about you? What's it like in the US?

**Stanley**: I'm based in San Francisco, California. The weather here is `pretty mild` `year-round`, but we do get some fog and cool temperatures, especially in the mornings and evenings.

**Sophie**: That sounds nice. We don't get much `fog` in Rio, but we do get a lot of rain in the summer. What's the currency in the US again?

**Stanley**: We use the US Dollar. How about in Brazil?

**Sophie**: We use the Brazilian Real. The exchange rates can be quite interesting sometimes.

**Stanley**: Yeah, definitely. So, what do you like to do in your free time?

**Sophie**: I enjoy going to the beach, hiking, and dancing samba. I also love reading and playing video games. What about you?

**Stanley**: I like to go hiking too, and I'`m really into` photography. I also enjoy cooking and trying out new recipes.
