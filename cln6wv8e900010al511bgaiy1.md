## Install CRA

```ruby
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Output

**Create React App (CRA)** is an official command-line tool provided by the React team and the Facebook development community. It simplifies the process of setting up and bootstrapping new React.js applications.

CRA generates a complete and well-structured React project with all the essential files, configurations, and development tools preconfigured, allowing developers to start building React applications quickly without the need to manually set up the project structure.

---

## Create react app

```ruby
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

Replace `my-react-app` with your actual app's name.

Output

The command `npx` is used instead of `npm` when creating a new React project with Create React App (CRA) because npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm (Node Package Manager) and is designed to make it easier to run packages that are not globally installed on your system.

In summary, the use of `npx` when creating React projects with CRA is a best practice that leverages the ability to run packages without global installations, making it easier to manage and use tools like Create React App while avoiding potential version conflicts.

## Navigate to the project folder

```ruby
cd my-react-app/
```

---

## Start the development server

```ruby
npm start
```

In order to start the development server and run your React application locally, use the previous command.

Output
