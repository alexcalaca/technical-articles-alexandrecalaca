## Identify the github link

Your github link pattern should probably look something like the following:

```plaintext
https://github.com/organization_name/repo_name
```

## Replace "com" with "dev"

Replace the `com` with `dev`.

Your new link should look something like the following:

```plaintext
https://github.dev/organization_name/repo_name
```

Press enter.
