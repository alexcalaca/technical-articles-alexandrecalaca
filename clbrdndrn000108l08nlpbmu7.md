# Deepin OS: How to configure tab size on Visual Studio Code using Deepin OS 20.7?

Hey guys, how's it going?

Today, we are going to learn how to configure tab size on Visual Studio Code using Deepin OS 20.7, a Debian based distro.

#### Introduction

`Visual Studio Code`, also commonly referred to as `VS Code`, is well known among software developers. It is an amazing open source code editor that combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle.

It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

#### 1 - Open VS Code settings

Go to `File -> Preferences -> Settings` or just click `CTRL+,` all at once.

#### 2 - Choose \`Tab Size\`

You can scroll down until you find it:

#### 4 - Disable auto detect indentation

By default, `VS Code` tries to guess your indentation configuration. In case you're interested, you can turn off this option by clicking on \`Editor: Detect Indentation\`
