Hey guys, how's it going?

Today, we are going to learn how to configure tab size on Visual Studio Code using Deepin OS 20.7, a Debian based distro.

#### Introduction

`Visual Studio Code`, also commonly referred to as `VS Code`, is well known among software developers. It is an amazing open source code editor that combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle.

It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

#### 1 - Open VS Code settings

Go to `File -> Preferences -> Settings` or just click `CTRL+,` all at once.

#### 2 - Choose \`Tab Size\`

You can scroll down until you find it:

Or you can type `tab size` on `Search settings`

#### 4 - Disable auto detect indentation

By default, `VS Code` tries to guess your indentation configuration. In case you're interested, you can turn off this option by clicking on \`Editor: Detect Indentation\`
