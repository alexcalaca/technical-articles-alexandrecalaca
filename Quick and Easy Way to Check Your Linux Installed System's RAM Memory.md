#### The LSB command

The `lsb_release -a` command is used to display certain LSB (Linux Standard Base) and distribution-specific information about the Linux distribution you are running.

It prints the following information:

* Distributor ID
    
* Description
    
* Release
    
* Codename
    
    This command is available on most modern Linux distributions that use the LSB. However, some smaller or less mainstream distributions may not have the command installed by default. In that case, you may need to install the lsb-release package to get access to the lsb\_release command.In programming, a collection refers to a data structure that stores a group of related elements. Collections are used to organize and manage data in a way that makes it easy to access and manipulate.

### dmidecode command

The `sudo dmidecode --type 17` command is a Linux command used to display information about memory devices installed on a computer system.

Specifically, it uses the `dmidecode` tool to retrieve the System Memory Array information, which includes details about the maximum capacity, type, and number of memory slots available on the system.

The `dmidecode` tool reads the system's DMI, which stands for Desktop Management Interface data, which is a standardized way to describe a computer's hardware components, such as the motherboard, BIOS, and peripherals.

By specifying `--type 17`, the command filters the output to only show information about the memory devices. The output includes details such as the manufacturer, part number, serial number, size, speed, and type of memory modules installed on the system.

---

### Summary

In this article, we learned how to use the `dmidecode` command. dmi stands for Desktop Management Interface data.

We used the `--type 17` argument, by using it, it output only information about the memory devices.
