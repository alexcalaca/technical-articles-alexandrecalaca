## Terminator

It is a terminal emulator for Linux and Unix-like operating systems.

A terminal emulator is a program that provides a graphical interface for users to access a command-line interface, allowing them to run text-based commands and interact with the system

---

## Check your OS

This step is optional. It's just to make sure you have `Fedora`installed.

---

### /etc/os-release

```plaintext
cat /etc/os-release
```

When you run `hostnamectl` without any options, it provides detailed information about the system's hostname, operating system, kernel, and other system-related settings.

## Solution

By using the `dnf` package manager, Let's install the `Terminator terminal emulator`

---

## DNF Package manager

### Meaning

`DNF` stands for "Dandified Yum." It is the next-generation package manager used in various Linux distributions, including Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

---

### Features

DNF was introduced as a replacement for the Yum package manager, and it offers improved performance, dependency resolution, and a more user-friendly command-line interface for package management tasks.

---

### Name origin

The name "Dandified Yum" is a play on words and a nod to Yum, which stands for "Yellowdog Updater, Modified."

---

## Open the terminal

---

## Update Fedora

```apache
sudo dnf update
```

Before installing any new packages, it's a good idea to update your system to make sure you have the latest package information and security updates.

---

## Install the package

Open the terminal and run the following command:

```apache
sudo dnf install terminator
```

The output will look something like the following:
