## AWS CLI

AWS CLI (Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface) is a unified tool provided by Amazon for managing AWS services from the command line.

It allows users to interact with various AWS services and resources directly through text-based commands, making it easier to automate tasks, script actions, and integrate AWS services into workflows.

### Configure the AWS SSO

```ruby
aws configure sso
```

AWS SSO is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that makes it easy to centrally manage access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications and to provide users with single sign-on access to them.

### Provide a session name

The Single Sign-On (SSO) start URL is a specific URL provided by AWS Single Sign-On that directs users to the SSO login page or the SSO portal where they can sign in and access their assigned AWS accounts and applications.

This URL is unique to your AWS account and is generated by AWS SSO.

Botocore is the low-level library that powers the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) and provides the foundation for the AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits) for Python.

It's responsible for handling the underlying communication with AWS services, such as sending requests and receiving responses.
