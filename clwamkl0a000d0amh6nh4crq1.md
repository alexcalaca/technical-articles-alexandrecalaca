## Warm up questions

1. What are some common strategies for optimizing database performance?
    
2. How do indexes contribute to improving database performance, and what factors should be considered when creating them?
    
3. What are composite indexes, and when are they useful in database optimization?
    
4. What is the purpose of analyzing complex queries using EXPLAIN plans, and how can it help in database optimization?
    
5. What is denormalization in the context of database design, and what are its potential advantages and disadvantages?

## Dialog

**Alan:** Hey Jeremy, have you had a chance to `look into` the `production issue` we're having? Our `database performance` has really taken a hit.

**Jeremy:** Yeah, I’ve been looking into it. I think we need to start with our `indexes`. I noticed we’re missing some on columns that are frequently queried. I’ll add those indexes first.

**Alan:** Sounds good. While you’re at it, let’s also check if we need any `composite indexes` for columns that are often used together in our **queries**. It should help `speed` things `up`.

**Jeremy:** Definitely. I’ll also analyze our complex queries using EXPLAIN plans. We might need to rewrite some of them for better `efficiency`. By the way, have you considered `denormalization` for some of our `read-heavy` tables?

**Alan:** Yes, I was thinking about that. **Denormalization** could reduce the number of joins and improve `read performance`. We should identify the tables that would benefit the most from this approach.

### Sample sentences

1. **Look into**:
    
    * Alan needs to look into the recent spike in database errors to identify the root cause.
        
2. **Take a hit**:
    
    * Our application’s response time has taken a hit since the last update.
        
3. **Production issue**:
    
    * The team is working around the clock to resolve the critical production issue affecting all users.
        
4. **Database performance**:
    
    * Improving database performance is essential to ensure our application runs smoothly under high load.
        
5. **Indexes**:
    
    * We added new indexes to the users table to speed up search queries.
        
6. **Speed up**:
    
    * To speed up the report generation, we optimized several SQL queries.
        
7. **Queries**:
    
    * Complex queries are causing significant delays in our system, so we need to optimize them.
        
8. **Efficiency**:
    
    * By rewriting the inefficient SQL statements, we significantly improved the efficiency of our data retrieval processes.
        
9. **Denormalization**:
    
    * We decided to implement denormalization in certain tables to reduce the number of joins required for our reports.
        
10. **Read-heavy**:
    
    * The denormalization strategy is particularly useful for our read-heavy tables, which are queried frequently.
        
11. **Read performance**:
    
    * Caching frequently accessed data has greatly enhanced read performance in our database.
