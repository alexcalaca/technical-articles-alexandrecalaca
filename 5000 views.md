Thank you for your support!

On `November 05th, 2023`, we reached 5000 views on my blog, with 159 published articles so far.

Other milestones include:

* 4000 views on September 06th, 2023;
    
* 3000 views on June 01st, 2023;
    
* 2000 views on April 26th, 2023;
    
* 1000 views on December 06th, 2022.
    

It might be simple, but I believe it's worth celebrating.

Life is worth living!
