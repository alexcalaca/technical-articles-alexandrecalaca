## Conversation

### Dialog

**Jeremy:** We have `connection pooling` `set up`, but I think we need to optimize it. We might also need to `limit connections` to prevent `overloads`. Setting a reasonable limit on the number of concurrent connections could help.

**Alan:** Good point. Let’s review our connection pool settings and adjust them as needed. Have you considered `caching`? We could use Redis or Memcached to cache frequently accessed data.

**Jeremy:** Yes, implementing `caching` at the application level can significantly reduce the `load` on our database. We can also `look into` any caching mechanisms provided by the database itself.

**Alan:** Sounds like a plan. Let’s start with `indexing` and `query optimization`, then move on to `fine-tuning` the configuration and setting up caching. I’ll handle the indexes and query analysis. Can you `look into` the hardware and configuration upgrades?

**Jeremy:** Sure thing. I’ll also check our `connection pooling` settings and set up a plan for data purging. Let’s `regroup` tomorrow and see how things are progressing.

**Alan:** Perfect. Let’s get to work and solve this issue `once and for all.`
