## Github branch

In Git, a branch is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. It is essentially a label that points to a specific commit in the Git repository's commit history.

When you create a new branch, it allows you to diverge from the main line of development and make changes without affecting the main branch.

### Git status

When you run `git status`, Git displays the name of the current branch in the output.

```ruby
git status
```

Look for the line that says "On branch &lt;branch\_name&gt;".

### Git branch

Running `git branch` will list all local branches, with the current branch highlighted with an asterisk (`*`).

```ruby
git branch
```

### Show current

When using the `git branch --show-current` command, you directly display the name of the current branch.

```ruby
git branch --show-current
```
