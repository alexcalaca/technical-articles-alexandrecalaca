## Debian

Debian is a popular and influential open-source operating system known for its stability, security, and commitment to free and open-source software principles.

It serves as the foundation for various other Linux distributions, including Ubuntu and many others.

Debian has a rich history and has been influential in shaping the landscape of the Linux and open-source software world. Its commitment to stability, security, and open source makes it a trusted choice for server deployments, development environments, and personal desktops.

## Debian-based distribution

Knowing if your operating system is Debian-based is crucial for efficient system management and software compatibility.

Understanding your OS's heritage can lead to smoother updates, troubleshooting, and adherence to Debian's security advisories.

Moreover, it helps you navigate the Linux community and access relevant documentation and support channels.

Different Linux distributions have specific resources and forums tailored to their users. Being part of the Debian-based community ensures you receive guidance and support aligned with your system's configuration and practices.

## Methods

Each operating system has its unique configuration, and that's why we offer multiple methods to help identify whether your OS is Debian-based.

The `lsb_release -a` command is used to display detailed information about the Linux distribution on your system.

It stands for "Linux Standard Base release" and provides information such as the distribution's name, release number, codename, and more.

### 2-Linux installed

```apache
cat /etc/os-release
```

Possible output:

The `cat /etc/os-release` command in the terminal will display the contents of the `/etc/os-release` file, which contains information about the Linux distribution installed on your system.

if it's Debian-based, you might see something in `ID_LIKE`,  
`UBUNTU_CODENAME` or another attribute.

### 3-Kernel version

```apache
uname -r
```

When you run `uname -r` in a terminal, it will output a string that represents the kernel version.

This information can be useful for various purposes, such as checking the kernel version for compatibility with certain software or drivers, troubleshooting system issues, or simply gaining a better understanding of your system's configuration.

### 4-Display Debian version

```apache
cat /etc/debian_version
```

Possible output:

### 7-Inxi command-line utility tool

`inxi` is a versatile command-line tool that provides extensive system information, making it useful for system administrators, troubleshooting, or simply gaining insights into your system's setup.

---
