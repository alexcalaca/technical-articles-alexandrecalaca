## An .ovpn file

An .ovpn file is a configuration file used by the OpenVPN (Open Virtual Private Network) software to establish a secure connection between your device and a VPN (Virtual Private Network) server.

OpenVPN is an open-source software that enables the creation of secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities.

## Create the directory

This directory is going to store the `.ovpn` file.

```plaintext
mkdir ~/.vpn-configs
```

---

## Copy the .ovpn file

```plaintext
cp somewhere/file.ovpn newplace/
```

It would look something like this

```plaintext
cp ~/Downloads/master-file.ovpn ~/.vpn-configs/
```

---

## Verify the copy

```plaintext
ls ~/.vpn-configs/
```

Your `.ovpn` file should be in that directory.

---

## Connect to VPN

```plaintext
sudo openvpn ~/.vpn-configs/master-file.ovpn
```

Output
