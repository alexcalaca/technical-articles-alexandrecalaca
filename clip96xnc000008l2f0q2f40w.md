## **Problem**

How to log in automatically to /bin/bash as the default shell in Deepin OS

---

## **Solution**

### **Check your OS**

In the terminal, you can check your operating system by running the following command

```apache
lsb_release -a
```

The solution provided by this article was tested using `Deepin Os 20.7`. You can check it out if works in your operating system.

You'll see something like this

### **Check your default shell**

In the terminal, you can check your default shell in Deepin OS by running the following command

```apache
echo $SHELL
```

You should be able to see something like this

### Open bash\_profile

Open the `home` directory. Press `CTRL + H.`

Open the file `.bash_profile` with your favorite text editor. I use `sublime text`.

You should see something like this

---

### Login shell

Add the following line to the file

```apache
exec /bin/bash
```

This line instructs Deepin OS to execute `/bin/bash` as the login shell when you log in.

---

### Restart the terminal

After following these steps, Deepin OS will automatically start a login shell session with `/bin/bash` as the default shell each time you log in to your user account.
