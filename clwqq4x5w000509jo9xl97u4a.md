### Dialog

**Alex:** Hey Jamie, you look a bit stressed out. Everything okay?

**Jamie:** Honestly, Alex, I've been struggling with `anxiety` lately. It's been really `overwhelming`.

**Alex:** I'm sorry to hear that. What usually triggers your anxiety?

**Jamie:** A lot of things, but mainly work and social situations. I try to `avoid` them, but it's not always possible.

**Alex:** I understand. Avoiding triggers can be tough. Have you tried any strategies to `cope with` it?

**Jamie:** Yeah, I've been trying a few things. Sometimes I just need to stop and breathe deeply. It helps a bit.

**Alex:** That's a good start. Deep breathing can really help calm you down. Have you considered therapy?

**Jamie:** Yes, I started therapy a few weeks ago. My therapist is helping me find ways to manage my anxiety better.

**Alex:** That's great to hear. Therapy can be really beneficial. Do you feel it's helping?

**Jamie:** It is. I still have a long way to go, but it's nice to have someone to talk to and get professional advice.

**Alex:** For sure. And remember, I'm here for you too. If you ever need to talk or need help with anything, just let me know.

**Jamie:** Thanks, Alex. I appreciate it. I've also been trying to pray more. It helps me feel a bit more `grounded`.

**Alex:** That's good. Finding what works for you is important. Just take it one step at a time.

**Jamie:** Thanks for the support. It really means a lot.

**Alex:** Anytime, Jamie. We’ll get through this together.
