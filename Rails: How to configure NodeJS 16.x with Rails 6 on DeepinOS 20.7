# Rails: How to configure NodeJS 16.x with Rails 6 on DeepinOS 20.7

Hey guys, how have you been?

Today, we are going to learn how to configure `NodeJS 16.x` with Rails 6 on DeepinOS 20.7.

### Introduction

`Node.jsÂ®` is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It works as an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.

`Node.js` is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like [Ruby's Event Machine](https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine) and Python's Twisted.

#### **1 - Install the NodeSource**

```ruby
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
```

You should be able to see something like this
