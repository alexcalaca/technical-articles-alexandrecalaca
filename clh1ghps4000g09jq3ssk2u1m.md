#### Greeting

Hey guys. It's AC Alexandre Cala√ßa here. How have you been?

---

#### Introduction

The goal of this article is to demonstrate how to include current git branch and path into bash prompt.

This article is tested in Debian based linux distributions.

---

#### Current environment

This is my current OS.

```apache
lsb_release -a
```

Output is something like this:

#### Open bash configuration

Open your file management tool and open `Home`. Press `CTRL+H` and open the file .bashrc.

---

#### Include the following commands

```apache
export PS1="\u@\h \[\e[32m\]\w \[\e[91m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\e[00m\]$ "
```

The previous command defines a new value for the environment variable PS1, which controls the format of the command prompt.

To be more specific, let's take a look at each part:

* `\u` expands to the username of the current user.
    
* `\h` expands to the hostname of the machine.
    
* `\[\e[32m\]` and `\[\e[91m\]` are ANSI escape sequences that set the text color to green and red, respectively.
    
* `\w` expands to the current working directory.
    
* `$(parse_git_branch)` is a command substitution that calls the `parse_git_branch` function to display the current Git branch name.
    
* `\[\e[00m\]` is an ANSI escape sequence that resets the text color to the default.

IT worked like a charm!!
