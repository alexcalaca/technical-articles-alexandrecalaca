or just use the following shortcut:

CTRL + SHIFT + P
```

The Command Palette is a powerful feature that allows you to execute various commands and tasks within VS Code.

It provides a quick way to access and run commands without having to navigate through menus.

## Type "Simple browser"

When you open the Command Palette, you'll see a text input field where you can start typing the name of a command or task.

As you type, the Command Palette filters the available commands based on your input, making it easy to find and execute the desired command.
